 ok:
-----
- reestablish function:
    - provide... into SvgSlide
    - preload... into SvgPresentation
    - update interface classes
- get correct movie sizes and positions using inkscape
- pdf output
- allow for svg display -> problems
- allow for pdf display
- fix buffer
- check movie start
- check scherenbild
- buffered display
- proper screen handling 
 
 TODO:
-------
- how to well deal with appendix? (easy: switching audience display on/off + presenter same as audience)
- script that takes movies to the current folder and changes the svg file accordingly; make sure that loading of the movies then also works from a different directory
- tidy up pixmap buffer implementation: use base class for worker thread, every SlideArea has its own pixmap buffer with a different drawer thread class (e.g. presenters display uses simple raster)

- inkscape extension: insert/modify movie
- inkscape extension: to comfortably switch between slides (next, previous, first, last; more comfortable switcher with thumbnails to choose, thumbnails are buffered, maybe embedded in svg, per layer)
- problem with buffer; try to get it newly whenever something is missing
- embed movie in svg? how about using cElementTree if things become too slow?
- inkscape extension: move all movies to integer positions -> evtl. Schnapsidee (movies innerhalb von Gruppen / transforms?)
- playonclick functionality
- presenters display with: time, loading type, buffer status
- movie overlaps using QGraphicsScene/-view

- check for double data in memory, on disk
- Benutzung des Programms soll auch ohne libvlc m√∂glich sein.
- presentation extension for inkscape
